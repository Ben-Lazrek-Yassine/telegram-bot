# Telegram Bot Toolkit
## Features

### Mass Direct Messaging

Easily send direct messages (DMs) to multiple users using your Telegram accounts. This feature is useful for broadcasting announcements, updates, or promotions to your audience.

### Member Scraping

Scrape members from Telegram groups and channels. Gather a list of users that you can engage with later, helping you expand your network or userbase.

### Auto Add to Group

Automatically add scraped members to your own group. Grow your community effortlessly by inviting users who have shown interest in your content.

### Dynamic Sleep Times

Customize the sleep time between sending each DM. This helps simulate a more human-like interaction pattern, preventing bot-like behavior.
